# gem template

This is a GitHub template for creating Ruby gems. Press [**Use this template**](https://github.com/g2crowd/gem/generate) to generate a project from this template. In the generated project, run this script to rename the gem to meet your needs:

```
$ brew install asdf
$ brew install lefthook
$ lefthook install
$ ruby rename_template.rb
```

Note that to get the full benefits of the script, you will need the [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) command installed.

This template is based on `bundle gem` with some notable improvements:

- GitHub Actions configuration
- CommitLint
- Rspec
- Rubocop with a good set of configuration
- [release-drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) GitHub Action for automating release notes
- A nice README
